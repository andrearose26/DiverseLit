            It began in a quiet sort of way, over hot cocoa and toasted
            marshmallows in a student room at Somerville College, Oxford.
            One evening in November 1912, some new friends, all first-year
            students, gathered “to read aloud our literary efforts and to
            receive and deliver criticism.” They brought stories, poems,
            essays, plays, and fables, and they received far more than
            merely criticism. In the firelight, over economical treats, they
            created a space in which they could grow beyond the limitations
            of Edwardian girlhood and become complex, creative adults with a
            radically capacious notion of what it might mean to be both
            human and female.

            The group was named by its best-known member, Dorothy L. Sayers,
            who would go on to be a famous detective novelist and popular
            theologian. Let’s call ourselves the Mutual Admiration Society,
            she suggested, because that’s what people will call us anyway.
            The name both captures the spirit of the group and misrepresents
            it. They supported each other boldly and emphatically: no false
            modesty or feminine shame here. They were willing to be
            relentless and did not insist on being liked, crucial qualities
            for taking advantage of the real but tenuous space they had to
            work within. But they were the exact opposite of the simple echo
            chamber of praise that the name could imply, in its pejorative
            sense. They were critical, and they were at odds. They fell
            apart and came together again, over the course of decades and
            remarkable careers that ranged from birth control advocacy to
            genre fiction, from classrooms to the stage.

            Four members of the Mutual Admiration Society (MAS) are at the
            heart of this story. Dorothy L. Sayers was known to her friends
            by her initials, DLS. Serious and a little weird, DLS was
            absorbed in her study of French literature and fascinated by the
            Middle Ages and religion. She would gain fame in adulthood as
            the creator of Lord Peter Wimsey, the aristocratic detective who
            starred in her mystery novels. Later, she would be equally well
            known for the essays and plays she wrote to expound her
            particular understanding of Christianity and personal ethics.

            Muriel St. Clare Byrne, who arrived at Somerville two years
            later than the others, would become DLS’s closest collaborator.
            Like DLS, she’d loved tales of knights and chivalry and
            derring-do as a youngster; as an adult, she paid court to the
            women who became her lovers and partners, immortalizing the
            experience in verse and drama. She, too, became a wide-ranging
            writer, bringing Tudor history and Elizabethan literature to
            life in popular histories crammed with vivid detail. Charis
            Barnett, by contrast, was intensely social, enthusiastic, and
            empathetic, far more interested in people than in ideas. Her
            career would follow suit, as she raised four children while
            becoming a nationally known authority and advocate on
            child-rearing, birth control, maternal mortality, and juvenile
            delinquency.
